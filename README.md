## - Concept

Built around a simple idea:  
**Design less. Mean more.**

Every component, color, and line of code is intentional — blending minimalist design with scalable engineering.  
The result: a portfolio that reflects both aesthetic precision and technical discipline.

> “Engineering the web, pixel by pixel.”

Simplicity isn’t about less — it’s about intention.  
I build interfaces that merge functionality with form: fast, accessible, and visually bold.
